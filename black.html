<p> Black mana comes from swamps, where things fester and rot. Death, disease, selfishness, power at any cost - these are the twisted values of the darkness. Black magic is powerful and easy to wield, but it comes with a high price. Its spells and abilities can warp the mind, poison the land, and turn creatures into nothing. Dark minions, undead creatures, and unspeakable horrors are native to the swamp, and they're as self-serving and treacherous as the mages who commanded them. It is not completely evil, though it is often portrayed to be.
Black's allies are Red and Blue, while its enemies are White and Green. The most iconic black planswalker is Liliana Vess <br><br> 

The playstyle of a blackmage is to is unique in the sence, that they have many diffrent types of cards at their disposal. But in order to be able to play with such
an ansenal of tools, blackmages frequently must deal damage to themselve to be able to cast whatever it is they want. Life total, to a player using black spells, is just another resource they
can tap into. Black players will often have spells that destory something that their opponent controls, or force an opponent to choose something of their own to destory. Blackmages are also able to deploy
vampire, which steal the life of an opponent while restoring their own. With life total being nothing more than
a resource to blackmages, they will often put themselves a critcal life totals to gain advantages during the match. If they can keep opponents from finishing them off while at near death, they will swiftly overpower
their opponent. </p>
