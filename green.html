<p> Forests provide green mana, the color of life and nature. Green spells and abilities focus on making its creatures larger in order to beat their opponent into the ground, destroying "unnatural" artifacts and enchantments, or increasing mana production. With the power of green mana you can call powerful beasts to maul your enemies to a pulp.
Green's allies are White and Red, while it's enemies are Black and Blue. The most iconic green planeswalker is Nissa Revane <br><br>

A Green mages biggest strenght is in its numbers. In the eyes of a greenmage, the biggest strongest army wins. Greenmages are also the best at producing mana. They have many different tools in their repertoire that allow a greenmage to
create an huge surplus of mana. A player who decides to play green spells is gonig to play the game one of two ways.
Death by 1,000 papercuts, which essentially means they'll overwhelm you quick and early with many small creatures. Or summon one <b> MASSIVE </b> creature to trample over all of yours. In Magic, creatures that have
trample have the ability to see deal damage even if they are blocked by an opponents creature. How this work is if a creature with 15 power is blocked by a creature with 5 toughness. The blocking creature absorbs 5 of the 15
damage, dies, and the remaining 10 damages goes through to the opponent.
