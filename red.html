<p> Red mana comes from the Mountains and the fiery heart of the world itself. Red magic is filled with fire, frenzy, and storms of rock and lava. Its creatures are warlike and dangerous, ranging from mighty dragons to hordes of rampaging goblins. Mages who master red magic have no patience for talk or subtlety. They act quickly and recklessly. Red mages can channel their wild emotions to crush the ground you walk on or to wield flame like a living weapon.
Red's allies are Black and Green, while its enemies are White and Blue. The most iconic red planeswalker is Chandra Nalaar<br><br>

Speed is the name of the game for redmages. If you're a player who chooses red as his/her color, you're going to want to deal as much damage as possible, as quick as possible
to try to take your opponent's life to 0 before they have a chance to rebuttal. The creatures that redmages contorl are often cheap to cast and are fairly fragile but often have haste,
which allows them to attack the same turn they were cast. This is what gives redmages an element of speed. As soon as their creatures on on the battlefield, they're coming at you. Redmages 
also have access to burn spells. These kinds of spells instantly deal damage to their opponent's creatures or their opponent directly. The two of those characteristics combined allow redmages to be blazing quick. Also,
just like how blackmages have vampires, and whitemages have angels at their disposal, redmages are able to command powerful dragons.  </p>
