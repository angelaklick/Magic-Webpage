<p> Islands provide blue mana, the color of the deep sea and the endless sky. The strength of blue magic lies in trickery and manipulation. Blue mages work behind the scenes, scheming and stealing secrets, controlling their environments completely before making a move. Blue spells and abilities focus on "borrowing" opponents' cards and drawing the right card at the right time. With the power of blue, call wizards and weird beasts of the air and oceans to serve you.
Blue's allies are White and Black, while its enemies are Green and Red. The most iconic blue planeswalker is Jace Beleren. <br><br> 

Players who choose to play blue spells will find that the playstyle of the cards will focus on controling the tempo of the game.
They will be able to choose from cards that will allow them to counter-spell, bounce (return something to owners hand), and draw. This allows them to disrupt their opponents strategy while gaining an advantage in the amount of cards they have in their hand.
The main goal of a "blue mage" (player) is to try to disrupt their opponent long enough so that their game plan has minimal effect on them and/or until they've baited their opponent into a unfavorable position and then unleash a very powerful creature that they ultimately
can not deal with </p>
