<p> White is the color of order, light, and healing. White creatures lay down the law and enforce it. Many white cards represent knights, castles and soldiers. Others represent creatures that live on the plains. Angels are powerful protectors in the sky, and clerics protect the weak and injured. It is not necessarily good, though white will often present itself in this way.
White's allies are Blue and Green, while its enemies are Red and Black. The most iconic white planeswalker is Elspeth Tirel <br><br>

A player who decided to choose white as his mana will find that the creatures he/she controls will be incredibly resilient, and to guard their life in more than one way.
Creatures of whitemages specialize in the combat phase of the game. They often have abilites such as first strike, allowing them to strike first in combat, possibly killing
their foe before taking damage. Vigilance, allowing them to both go on the offensive and stay back to play defense. And lifelink, which gives their whitemage points to their life total
based on the amount of damage they dealt. Whitemages are the inverse of their counterpart; the blackmage. While blackmages use thier life as an additional resource and depoly specialized
vampires, Whitemages see thier life as precious and have access to powerful angels. A whitemages key to victory in matches is to challenge thier opponent with strong warriors that prove to be
just too effective at combat to overcome, while boosting your lifetotal well past 20.
